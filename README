Simple NUMA policy support. It consists of a numactl program to run
other programs with a specific NUMA policy and a libnuma to do
allocations with NUMA policy in applications.

The kernel interface offered by this is subject to change.
For this reason it is recommended to only link the library as shared
library to make it easily replaceable. 

See the manpages numactl.8 and numa.3 for details.
