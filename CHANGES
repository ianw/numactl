[0.7 skipped]

0.8
- hardend numactl command line parsing against bad arguments in some cases
- remove cpumask/nodemask confusion which has become a FAQ:
  --cpubind deprecated, added --cpunodebind and --physcpubind= options
  print both in --show, old cpumask kept for compatibility
- Fix --show problems
- various fixes for bugs noted by Mike Stroyan (thanks!)
- install set_mempolicy manpage
- various smaller fixes

0.9
- Get rid of bogus distance.o that broke compilation on !x86-64 (sorry)
- Handle CFLAGS overriding without OPT_CFLAGS (Ian Wienand)
- Fix up section of get/set_mempolicy (Ian Wienand)
- When no NUMA available fall back to one global node instead of one node
per CPU (Samuel Thibault)
- Don't rely on architecture symbols for dependency generation
- Use __powerpc__ to detect PPC/PPC64
- numastat: 
  * wrap display properly with many nodes
  * display nodes in forward order
  * install manpage in `make install'.
- remove bogus numamemcpy.c
- numademo: 
  * allow standalone compile, make streamlib optional
  * clean up output
  * change output unit to standard MB/s
  * compile with more optimization
  * add random pass to fool any prefetching (slow)
- make numademo compileable outside source tree
- use gettimeofday instead of time stamp counters in benchmarks
- support valgrind in testsuite
- other minor changes

0.9.1
- Make automatic selection of lib64 vs lib more robust. Now should work
even on ppc32 with a lib64 directory. Architecture lists are hardcoded now
unfortunately.

(MIPS, Alpha, Sparc)

Lameter. Requires 2.6.16+ kernels

0.9.3
- Some more manpage fixes
- install migratepages manpage in make install
- Build fix for Debian make from Ian Wienand

0.9.4:
- Remove syscall manpages. They're in main man-pages now.
- More migrate fixes from C.Lameter

0.9.5:
- Fix parsing of cpumap in sysfs from Doug Chapman

- Don't corrupt errno in numa_run_on_node_mask. This fixes
numactl cpubind issues on some systems.
- Print cpus belonging to nodes in numactl --hardware
- Rewrite cpumap parser to be simpler and hopefully finally work
in all cases
- add testcases for cpu affinity and topology discovery
- Add make test target to run regression test easier and fix up
test/README
