[Note: newer entries are at the bottom]

Early prehistory:

- Fix some warnings
- Add const to global variables and prototypes
- Document numa_warn
- Add numa_distance() support to read topology
- remove internal alias from numa_{warn,error} to allow overwriting
  again
- Various bug fixes
- add -f option to memhog to map file
- more bugfixes
- replace forward backward with STREAM test in numademo

0.6.1

- make headers C++ clean

0.6.2 

- use more accurate buffer length for cpumask
- add --cpubind to test suite

0.6.3

- fix cpumask parser for large number of cpus.
Note that you need a kernel patch (as of 2.6.7-pre) for that too
if the cpumask is longer than 99 characters.

0.6.4

- Add Coppyright headers

0.6.5

- Reduce unneeded DSO relocations (Arjan van de Ven) 
- Add -r option to memhog (repeat walk) 
- some manpage fixes
- Use syscall numbers from asm/unistd.h if possible
- Add numa_node_size64 to handle large nodes on 32bit architectures
- Fix numactl to use it (report from Rajan Ravindran) 
- Use ln -sf in make install (Rajan Ravindran)
- Add syscall numbers for ppc/ppc64
- Add private syscall6 for i386 since the glibc version is broken
- Remove STUB
- Change numactl --show to use cpubind instead of nodebind for CPU affinity.
- Fix make install into examples directory
- Work around broken sched_set_affinity API. This adds a 32768 CPUs limit.
- Fix segfault with /sys not mounted.
- Clean up Makefile
- Make numactl --show more clever

0.7-pre1

- add test/regress2 and some fixes to test programs
- Fix DSO relocation patch for global variables
- Change nodeset sizes back to be binary compatible with SLES9
- Cosmetic changes to manpages (pointed out by Eric S. Raymond) 
- Make numa_run_on_node etc. act on current thread only even on NPTL systems
  (Dinakar Guniguntala)
- Make numa_no_nodes / numa_all_nodes const (Werner Almesberger) 
- Fix up the warnings caused by above change
- Add numa_distance() on systems with ACPI
- remove some obsolete code
- add rdtsc for ppc64
- fix unsigned/unsigned long confusion in cpumasks (Matt Dobson)
- fix CPU_BYTES and rename CPU_WORDS to CPU_LONGS (Matt Dobson) 
- Print node distances in numactl

[0.7 skipped]

0.8
- hardend numactl command line parsing against bad arguments in some cases
- remove cpumask/nodemask confusion which has become a FAQ:
  --cpubind deprecated, added --cpunodebind and --physcpubind= options
  print both in --show, old cpumask kept for compatibility
- Fix --show problems
- various fixes for bugs noted by Mike Stroyan (thanks!)
- install set_mempolicy manpage
- various smaller fixes

0.9
- Get rid of bogus distance.o that broke compilation on !x86-64 (sorry)
- Handle CFLAGS overriding without OPT_CFLAGS (Ian Wienand)
- Fix up section of get/set_mempolicy (Ian Wienand)
- When no NUMA available fall back to one global node instead of one node
per CPU (Samuel Thibault)
- Don't rely on architecture symbols for dependency generation
- Use __powerpc__ to detect PPC/PPC64
- numastat: 
  * wrap display properly with many nodes
  * display nodes in forward order
  * install manpage in `make install'.
- remove bogus numamemcpy.c
- numademo: 
  * allow standalone compile, make streamlib optional
  * clean up output
  * change output unit to standard MB/s
  * compile with more optimization
  * add random pass to fool any prefetching (slow)
- make numademo compileable outside source tree
- use gettimeofday instead of time stamp counters in benchmarks
- support valgrind in testsuite
- other minor changes

0.9.1
- Make automatic selection of lib64 vs lib more robust. Now should work
even on ppc32 with a lib64 directory. Architecture lists are hardcoded now
unfortunately.

0.9.2
- Fix compilation on architectures with gcc 3.3+ but without TLS
(MIPS, Alpha, Sparc) 
- Add warning against using of MPOL_F_NODE
- numa.3 improvements from Michael Kerrisk
- Support page migration (migratepages, manpages) from Christoph
Lameter. Requires 2.6.16+ kernels

0.9.3
- Some more manpage fixes
- install migratepages manpage in make install
- Build fix for Debian make from Ian Wienand

0.9.4:
- Remove syscall manpages. They're in main man-pages now.
- More migrate fixes from C.Lameter

0.9.5:
- Fix parsing of cpumap in sysfs from Doug Chapman

0.9.6:
- Fix make install again
