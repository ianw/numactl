Various simple test scripts to verify some parts of the NUMA API.

You should have at least two nodes for the test suite. For x86-64
there is a patch in numa-emu-2 that allows to simulate multiple nodes
on a non NUMA machine.

The tests in regress assume that there is enough memory free on nodes 0/1.
They consider PREFERRED/INTERLEAVE not hitting the first choice node an 
error. 

TBD: more detailed unit tests for mbind / shm / {get,set}_mempolicy
Currently everything is tested using numactl only.
